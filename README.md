## Overview
This Rust program shows how to implement a homomorphism from the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ to the integers modulo $n$Â $\mathbb{Z}_n$. It defines a trait for homomorphisms and provides a specific implementation that maps integers to their equivalence classes modulo $6$. The concept of a homomorphism is important in abstract algebra because it preserves the structure of two algebraic systems.
## How it works
- **Homomorphism Trait:** The program defines a generic Homomorphism<T>  trait with a single method map(&self, input: T) -> T. This method represents the homomorphism function that maps an element of type T to another element of the same type.
- **ModHomomorphism Struct:** A struct ModHomomorphism is defined to represent a homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_6$. The struct contains a field modulus, which is used to perform the modulo operation.
- **Implementation Details:** The trait Homomorphism<i32> is implemented for ModHomomorphism, where the map function performs the modulo operation:
>```
>impl Homomorphism<i32> for ModHomomorphism {
>fn map(&self, input: i32) -> i32 {
> input % self.modulus
>}
>}
