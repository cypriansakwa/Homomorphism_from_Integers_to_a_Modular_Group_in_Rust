## Overview
This Rust program shows how to implement a homomorphism from the set of integers ($\mathbb{Z}$) to the integers modulo $n$Â ($\mathbb{Z}_n$). The concept of a homomorphism is important in abstract algebra because it preserves the structure of two algebraic systems.

## Usage
- To use this code, you can clone the repository.
- You can change the values of $q,n$ and $m$ in the main function to test different cases.
- Compile the Rust code using cargo:
>```
>cargo build
>cargo run
